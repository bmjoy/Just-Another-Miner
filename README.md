# Just-Another-Miner

A demo Incremental game based on Idle Planet Miner.  
It's my first unity project and is currently not finished, don't think i'll ever come back to it.  
Most assets/resources in this repo do not belong to me and are used as dummy visuals.  

In this project, you can  
1 - Use Currency to Buy and upgrade Mines on different planets to acquire different type of Ores  
2 - Transform said ores to Bars increasing their value by Buying and using Smelters  
3 - Sell Ores/Bars to acquire currency  
4 - Perform Research (right now using only currency) to have access to new planet's mines and better resource generation
